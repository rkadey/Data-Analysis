# Introduction
Regular expressions (regex) are essentially text patterns that you can use to automate searching through and replacing elements within strings of text. 

This can make cleaning and working with text-based data sets much easier, saving you the trouble of having to search through mountains of text by hand.

# Run Locally
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rkadey/Data-Analysis-Projects.git
